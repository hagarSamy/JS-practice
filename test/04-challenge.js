/* 1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and 'players2')
The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) 2. create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name,
and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players
   3. Csreate an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)
During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) ued 3 substitute players. So 4. create a new array ('players Final') containing all the original teaml players plus 'Thiago', 
'Coutinh'o and 'Perisic'
Based on the game.odds object, 5. create one variable for each odd (called 'teaml', 'draw' and 'team2')
---
The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. 7. Print to the console which team is more likely to win, WITHOUT using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.
SC
TEST DATA FOR 6: Use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'. Then, call the function again with players from game.scorerd

// Coding Challenge #2 OR 5

/* 
Let's continue with our football betting app!

1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console, along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console
3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exaclty like this:
      Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
      Odd of draw: 3.25
      Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them (except for "draw"). HINT: Note how the odds and the game objects have the same property names ðŸ˜‰

BONUS: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the players who scored as properties, 
and the number of goals as the value. In this game, it will look like this:
      {
        Gnarby: 1,
        Hummels: 1,
        Lewandowski: 2
      }

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
